# So You Want To Release A Game On Steam...

➡️ Are you an indie developer looking to release a game on the gaming platform Steam and want to learn more about what will make your game successful on the platform? 

➡️ What types of games are customers buying on Steam?

➡️ What games out there are similar to the one you are releasing?

➡️ What are the chances that you can sell 20,000+ copies if you make a single-player, action-adventure game for pc and mac, release a video trailer, and have a few steam achievements? - Too specific?

This project combines clustering, classification and recommender methods to help give indie developers some insights into the Steam platform and determine what types of games and features will make your game more successful.
